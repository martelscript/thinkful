            <h3>Who I am</h3>
            </div>
            <p>My name is Adam Martel Brown and I am an aspiring Software Engineer</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Where am I?</h3>
            </div>
            <p>I am currently in Bethesda, Maryland but I have lived all over the world though! I was born in Florida and I have lived in the following states:
                <ul> <li>Georgia 
                    <li>South Carolina 
                    <li>North Carolina
                    <li>Virginia 
                    <li>Maryland 
                    <li>Wisconsin
                    <li>California</li> 
                    </ul>
                    I have also lived in Senegal (West Africa), Iraq (deployment) and South Korea (duty station)!</p>

                <h3>Tell you about myself</h3>
                </div>
            <p>I am a citizen of the world! I know lots of people say that but I really mean it! I have yet to go anywhere that I struggled to fit in and I am equally proficient working as a part of a team or as a lone wolf. During the last few days of my time in the US Army, I met with my career counselor and he asked me "What would you do with your time in a world where money didn't matter?"; my answer was I would build software that makes people's lives easier. This was in 2011!</p>
            <p>Outside of web development, I enjoy traveling with my wife and my favorite soccer team AC Milan!</p>
